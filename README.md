# SaitaBot-PY

My Discord bot, developed in Python, using Discord.py.

## Installation

Clone this repository, and install the dependencies by using `py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py` (if you are in Windows).
Once everything is installed, you can start the bot by running the main.py file by using `py -3 main.py`.

## Configuration File

There's a hidden file that stores sensitive information, called `config.py` (path: assets).
If you want to run the bot, you must create it inside of the bot's folder.
